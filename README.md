# Poisonous Mushroom Classification

North American mushrooms are often used in a wide range of cooking applications. However some are poisonous and some aren't. Can you identify which are safe to eat?

## Dataset
This dataset contains 8124 entries corresponding to 23 species of gilled mushrooms from North America. Each species is identified as definitely edible (e), definitely poisonous (p), or of unknown edibility and not recommended (also p). Each entry has 22 features related to the physical characteristics of the mushroom. The feature labels are explained in the file `labels.txt`.

## Guidance
This is not an exhaustive list of tasks, the points are provided in order to guide you:

### Correlations
Visualise the distribution of features and find the correlations between different features. Are any of the them strongly correlated with each other?

### Model
Try a number of different models and test their accuracy, find the most appropriate model for this dataset.

### Evaluation
Report your results for different models utilising appropriate metrics. What was the most successful model and is there any particular reason for it?
